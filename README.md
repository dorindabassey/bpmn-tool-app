## Bpmn Tool App

**&nbsp;ℹ&nbsp;Note**:

- We recommend a Chromium-based web browser for local development with HTTP. \
  Safari enforces HTTPS; therefore, it doesn't allow localhost through HTTP.

### About the app

This app is a custom Miro plugin that imports BPMN .bpmn files into a Miro board, visually replicating process diagrams. It parses the BPMN XML, maps elements like tasks, gateways, events, and annotations to Miro shapes, and draws connectors between them with directional logic (e.g., elbowed arrows, vertical or horizontal flow).

The app also:
- Handles diverging/converging gateways with smart spacing
- Applies icons (e.g., 👤, 🖥️) to represent participants or systems
- Supports exporting selected shapes back into valid BPMN XML

It’s designed to provide visual clarity and preserve BPMN semantics inside Miro for collaborative process modeling.

<!-- describe shortly the purpose of the sample app -->

Built using [`create-miro-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-miro-app).

This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). \
If you want to modify the `vite.config.js` configuration, see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

### How to start locally

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start developing. \
  Your URL should be similar to this example:
 ```
 http://localhost:3000
 ```
- Paste the URL under **App URL** in your
  [app settings](https://developers.miro.com/docs/build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-configure-your-app-in-miro).
- Open a board; you should see your app in the app toolbar or in the **Apps**
  panel.

### How to build the app

- Run `npm run build`. \
  This generates a static output inside [`dist/`](./dist), which you can host on a static hosting
  service.

### Folder structure

<!-- The following tree structure is just an example -->

```
.
├── src
│  ├── assets
│  │  └── style.css
│  ├── app.jsx      // The code for the app lives here
│  └── index.js    // The code for the app entry point lives here
├── app.html       // The app itself. It's loaded on the board inside the 'appContainer'
└── index.html     // The app entry point. This is what you specify in the 'App URL' box in the Miro app settings
```
